📌 **42 School - Network & Web Server Project**  

## 📝 Description
**Webserv** is a **custom HTTP server** written in **C++ 98**, built from scratch to handle HTTP requests, static content, CGI execution, and file uploads.  
It was developed as a **team project** with [Christophe Albor Pirame](https://github.com/CronopioSalvaje).  
This project helped us understand **how web servers like Nginx or Apache work** internally.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Supports multiple HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`)  
✅ **Handles multiple clients using `poll()` for non-blocking I/O**  
✅ **Processes requests with proper status codes & error handling**  
✅ **Parses a custom configuration file to define server behavior**  
✅ **Executes CGI scripts (Python, PHP, etc.)**  
✅ **Manages static file serving and directory listing**  
✅ **Supports multiple virtual hosts & ports**  
✅ **Allows file uploads via HTTP POST**  

## 🏆 Result: **125% Score**
The project was successfully validated with a **125% score**, including full implementation of mandatory and bonus features. 🎉

## 📁 Files
- `webserv.hpp` → Core server headers and data structures  
- `Server.cpp` → Handles socket binding, listening, and client requests  
- `Makefile` → Automates compilation (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `bonus`)  

## ⚙️ **Configuration File**
Webserv loads a **configuration file** defining **virtual hosts, routes, and CGI settings**.  
It supports **multiple server blocks**, similar to Nginx.  

**Example Configuration (`config.conf`):**
```conf
server {
    listen 8080;
    host 127.0.0.2;
    server_name default.42.fr;

    location / {
        root /www/default/html/;
        index index.html;
        methods GET;
    }
}
```

## 📂 **HTTP Features**
### 🔹 **Supported Methods**
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `GET` | Retrieves files from the server |
| `POST` | Uploads files or submits form data |
| `DELETE` | Removes files from the server |

### 🔹 **CGI Execution**
- **Executes Python/PHP scripts** in a sandboxed environment  
- **Parses CGI output** and sends it as an HTTP response  

### 🔹 **File Uploads**
- **Handles multipart form data** (`Content-Type: multipart/form-data`)  
- **Stores uploaded files** in a configurable directory  

## 🎯 **Bonus Features**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ **Multiple virtual hosts** | Supports multiple domain names |
| ✅ **Directory listing** | Enables browsing server files |
| ✅ **Custom error pages** | Displays user-defined error messages |
| ✅ **Load balancing (Round Robin)** | Distributes traffic across multiple backends |

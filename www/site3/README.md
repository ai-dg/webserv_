## :book: About the project
**Task:** Create 90's Style Website

* Start with the home page at index.html
* Create pages for individual topics. These can your interest, passions, family, cats, or anything else
* Link the different pages to one another (via nav or links in the content)
* Include images
* Make use of tags you learned
* Make use of CSS styling
* Make sure all your html page are validated via plugin (or you can always upload your HTML file here)
* Make 5-10 different pages. Put good content in them

**Output:** Inspired by the Rotten Tomatoes website, "Fresh Tomatoes" was created. It is possible to find the 10 best movies of different styles from the 90s to watch. To create an old and fun design, many colors, gifs and images were included, in addition to music on the pages.
